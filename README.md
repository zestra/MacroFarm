Welcome to my version of minecraft!

## How to Play 

First, you will start with a screen like this:

The blue box to the top left corner can be used to acess any of the blocks on the map.

After tapping on one of the blocks with this selection box, you can change what type of element it is. You can do this by tapping on an element in the elements table.

Hence you can customise your map.

If you particluarly like your map, you can save it, using the save button.

You can then access it and other maps or versions using the versions bar:

If you want to delete a specfic version, you can manually go to the text file containing the versions and select-delete the version you do not like.

However, be very careful to keep the format unaltered, because the writer file which reads and writes the versions heavily relies on the format.

Finally, you can exit with the QUIT button:

I hope you will enjoy using this applet, as I did myself while I made it.

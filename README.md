presents a recently updated version of the game. The update includes the introduction to animal reproduction, where animals, when given 3 pears, reproduce. It also contains the ability to grow trees from seeds when you provide it 2 watercans. There are also 2 new buildings: a well where you can collect water and a farm where you can transform the scene and yourself from a farmer in the forest, to a farmer in the desert. Lastly, old graphics have been updated, and new ones reproduced. Welcome to version number 4.

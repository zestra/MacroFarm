# Draft 6: A Diary

## 21 Jan 2023

The whole code redesign was started on 21 Jan 2023. So far, in one day, I have been able to preprogram the whole image directory, make a brand new range of classes, maps for each field, and the scrollable map ability. I am actually quite impressed with my pacing. Since I have had a lot of experience using pygame modules and python itself, it takes me 1/100 of the time to figure out what I need to code and to code it out compared to when I did so at the beginning of this career. Anyhow, here is the resulting program of 21 Jan 2023.

## 22 Jan 2023
On 22 Jan 2023, I was able to expand the player and animal classes, adding motion allgorithms and controls. I also added a health bar for each of the organisms, a feature which wasn't there before. Now, even animals can die; previously, they were incapable of recieving this blessing. Another brand new feature in MacroFarm is the island-map-view, which actually looks very nice in my opinion. Anyways, in addition, I made a directory for the player's inventory. Finally, I expanded the maps even more for the buildings and scenery fields. Again, I am really impressed with my pacing so far. The final draft of verion 6 might even come out early in Feburary! We'll see though. The resulting program of 22 Jan 2023 is shown below.

# Announcement: Draft 6 (New!)
I would like to announce that although this respository hasn't been updated in 5 months, MacroFarm hasn't been given up just yet. MacroFarm is going to recieve a gigantic new update in late Feburary, 2023, so don't forget to watch the repository to be notified about it.

In late January, 2023, I have been working tirelessly to redesign the whole code, making it neat, understandable, and modern.

After the whole code redesign, I am expecting to add a whole new purpose and set of features to the game, setting MacroFarm on a brand new course.

Don't forget, you can support MacroFarm by sharing it with your friends, joining MacroFarm's discussion group, starring, and watching the repository!

I'll see you then.

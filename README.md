# Draft 6: A Diary

## 21 Jan 2023

The whole code redesign was started on 21 Jan 2023. So far, in one day, I have been able to preprogram the whole image directory, make a brand new range of classes, maps for each field, and the scrollable map ability. I am actually quite impressed with my pacing. Since I have had a lot of experience using pygame modules and python itself, it takes me 1/100 of the time to figure out what I need to code and to code it out compared to when I did so at the beginning of this career. Anyhow, here is the resulting program of 21 Jan 2023. Just click on the image to see the code.



# Announcement: Draft 6 (New!)
I would like to announce that although this respository hasn't been updated in 5 months, MacroFarm hasn't been given up just yet. MacroFarm is going to recieve a gigantic new update in late Feburary, 2023, so don't forget to watch the repository to be notified about it.

In late January, 2023, I have been working tirelessly to redesign the whole code, making it neat, understandable, and modern.

After the whole code redesign, I am expecting to add a whole new purpose and set of features to the game, setting MacroFarm on a brand new course.

Don't forget, you can support MacroFarm by sharing it with your friends, joining MacroFarm's discussion group, starring, and watching the repository!

I'll see you then.

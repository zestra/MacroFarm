# MacroFarm

Welcome to my adventure game!

# Final Version: Draft 5 (New!)
v5 contains the next generation of MacroFarm. The update includes a brand new way of roaming the map. Now, your player is always centred, giving you the liberty of seeing him and the obstacles, items, and animals around him clearly. The inventory has also been updated, so that you can now scroll through it to see everything neatly. Version 5 also introduces a guide, which you can get hints from when you have forgotten something or want to try something new. Finally, for programmers interested in looking through the code, there are comments to help them out and the code has also been rearranged neatly. Welcome to version 5 of MacroFarm.

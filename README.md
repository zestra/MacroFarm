# Announcement: Draft 6 (New!)
The programmer, I, would like to announce that although this respository hasn't been updated in 5 months, MacroFarm hasn't been given up just yet. MacroFarm is going to recieve a gigantic new update in late Feburary, 2023, so don't forget to watch the repository to be notified about it.

In late January, 2023, the programmer has been working tirelessly to redesign the whole code, making it neat, understandable, and modern.

After the whole code redesign, the programmer will be expected to add a whole new purpose and set of features to the game, setting MacroFarm on a Brand new course.

So, don't forget to stay tuned!

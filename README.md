## Spring Major Update: v7.0 released!

Welcome back to MacroFarm! It has been 6 months, that's half a year!, since the last major update, which introduced a brand new way of roaming the map and interacting with the inventory. Since then, MacroFarm has advanced incredibly, from the outside and inside. So, let's dive in.

### 1. Object Oriented Programming

v1.0 of MacroFarm was first written in Pygzrun, which is a baby version of Pygame, but v2.0 took a leap ahead and was written in Pygame itself, which unlocked many new features and allowed much more flexibility. However, at the time, our developers were still new to keeping code neat, and so v2.0 was just a utter mess, composed of these super-mega functions, although it miraculously worked. So, on the very same month, v3.0 was released, with clear code all in one file. From v3.0 to v5.0, the code was clear and properly arranged and there wasn't supermega functions just thrown into one file, at least for the next 5 months. During this period when MacroFarm was abondoned and forgotten, our developers were learning about Object Oriented Programming, classes, parents and child classes, different ways of arranging dictionaries, lists, and so much more. And then finally, they came back to MacroFarm with their new standards, and declared it most dissatisfying and disorganized. This brought rise to v7.0, which very foundations are based on Object Oriented Programming, with a variety of parent and daughter classes, all with their own features and jobs. It also introduced brand new ways of arranging and interating dictionaries and lists. Thus, we are proud to introduce Object Oriented Programming to MacroFarm, making everything so much more neater and accessible, for the next few months or so at the least.
